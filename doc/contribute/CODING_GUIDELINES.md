# CODING GUIDELINES

This file list the guidelines to use when you want to contribute to SafeScale code.

## error messages

In general, follow the GOLANG coding guidelines, in particular:

- Don't use capitalized error messages
- Don't use punctuation at the end of the error messages

## code documentation

As much as possible, follow the [godoc documentation tool formalism](https://blog.golang.org/godoc-documenting-go-code).

## code indentation

- uses 4 spaces for indentation
- uses spaces instead of tab character for indentation

Good documentation is an everyday job (we still have to respect this mantra ourselves ;-) ).
