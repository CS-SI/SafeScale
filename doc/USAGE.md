SafeScale is composed of 2 parts:

 - a daemon working in background, called [`safescaled`](#safescaled)
 - a client interacting with the daemon, called [`safescale`](#safescale)
<br>

## safescaled

`safescaled` is a daemon and you only need to launch it on your own computer.
The purpose of this daemon is to execute requests ordered by `safescale` client on the providers.
<br>
It is composed internally of 2 layers:
- `Infra` which manages Cloud Provider resources with an abstraction layer
- `Platform` which allows to create and manage clusters

#### Configuration

To dialog with the different providers, the daemon needs authentication parameters to be able to connect to the underlying provider's API. These credentials are given in the file `tenants.toml` (may also be `tenants.json` or `tenants.yaml`, in their respective corresponding format). This file is searched in order (first file found is used) in the folowing directories:

> - . (current directory)
> - $HOME/.safescale
> - $HOME/.config/safescale
> - /etc/safescale

The content of this configuration file is explained in [TENANTS.md](TENANTS.md).

Each `tenants` section contains specific authentication parameters for each Cloud Provider.
> - `client` can be one of the available provider's drivers in
>    - aws
>    - cloudferro
>    - flexibleengine
>    - gcp
>    - local (unstable, not compiled by default, cf this [documentation](LIBVIRT_PROVIDER.md))
>    - openstack (pure OpenStack support)
>    - outscale
>    - opentelekom
>    - outscale
>    - ovh
> - `name` is a logical name representing the tenant
>

Here is an example of a tenant file:
```yaml
[[tenants]]
  name = "logical_name_for_this_ovh_tenant"
  client = "ovh"

  [tenants.identity]
    ApplicationKey = "your_application_key"
    OpenstackID = "your_login"
    OpenstackPassword = "your_password"

  [tenants.compute]
    Region = "your_region"
    ProjectName = "your_project_name_or_id"

  [tenants.network]
    ProviderNetwork = "Ext-Net"

  [tenants.objectstorage]
    Type = "swift"
    AuthURL = "https://auth.cloud.ovh.net/v3"

[[tenants]]
  client = "flexibleengine"
  name = "logical_name_for_this_flexibleengine_tenant"

  [tenants.identity]
    Username = "your_login"
    Password = "your_password"
    DomainName = "your_domaine_name"

  [tenants.compute]
    ProjectID = "your_project_id"
    Region = "your_region"

  [tenants.network]
    VPCName = "your_VPC_name"
    VPCCIDR = "your_VPC_cidr"

  [tenants.objectstorage]
    Type = "s3"
    Endpoint = "https://oss.eu-west-0.prod-cloud-ocb.orange-business.com"
    AccessKey = "your_S3_login"
    SecretKey = "your_S3_password"

[[tenants]]
  client = "opentelekom"
  name = "logical_name_for_this_opentelekom_tenant"

  [tenants.identity]
    Username = "your_login"
    Password = "your_password"
    DomainName = "your_domaine_name"

  [tenants.compute]
    ProjectID = "your_project_id"
    Region = "your_region"

  [tenants.network]
    VPCName = "your_VPC_name"
    VPCCIDR = "your_VPC_cidr"

  [tenants.objectstorage]
    Type = "s3"
    Endpoint = "https://obs.eu-de.otc.t-systems.com"
    AccessKey = "your_S3_login"
    SecretKey = "your_S3_password"
```

A more detailed description of the content of the file `tenants.toml` can be found in [TENANTS.md](TENANTS.md).
<br>

#### Usage

If you built SafeScale from source, ```make install``` will have installed the binaries in $GOPATH/bin.
To launch the SafeScale daemon, simply execute the following command (from a regular user, no need to be root):

```bash
${GOPATH}/bin/safescaled &
```

It should display in your terminal something like this:

```bash
Safescaled version: 19.03.0, build f3973fb5a642b7d93b0f20417631e2706a86c211 (2019/02/25-14:49)
Ready to serve :-)
```

By default, ```safescaled``` displays only warnings and errors messages. To have more information, you can use ```-v``` to increase verbosity, and ```-d``` to use debug mode (```-d -v``` will produce A LOT of messages, it's for debug purposes).
<br><br>

#### Options

option | description
----- | -----
`--verbose, -v` | Increase the verbosity.<br><br>ex: `safescale -v host create ...`
`--debug, -d` | Displays debugging information.<br><br>ex: `safescale -d host create ...`
`--listen, -l` | defines on what interface and what port safescaled will listen; default is `localhost:50051`

Examples:
```bash
$ safescaled 
```
will start the daemon, listening on `localhost` on default port `50051`; it will be reachable only from the same host.
<br>
```bash
$ safescaled -v -l :50000
```
will start the daemon, listening on all interfaces and on port `50000` (instead of default port 50051)
<br>

Note: `-d -v` will display far more debugging information than simply `-d` (used to trace what is going on in details)

You can also set some parameters of `safescaled` using environment variables, which are :
- SAFESCALED_LISTEN: equivalent to `--listen`, allows to tell `safescaled` on what interface and/or what port to listen on
- SAFESCALE_METADATA_SUFFIX: allows to specify a suffix to add to the name of the Object Storage bucket used to store SafeScale metadata on the tenant.
  This allows to "isolate" metadata between different users of SafeScale (practical in development for example). There is no equivalent command line parameter.
 
## safescale

`safescale` is the client part of SafeScale. It consists of a CLI to interact with the safescale daemon to manage cloud infrastructures.

The different available commands can be obtained via the **`--help`** option on each command and are listed hereafter. _Note that, despite of our efforts, the help got by the CLI might be more accurate and up-to-date than the following descriptions._

Each command returns its results on the standard output in 2 forms according to the expected result type:

- no result is expected: a simple comment about the execution of the command
- a result is expected: the result is formatted in **JSON** (or null if no result is produced); for eye-candy formatting, you can use `| jq` at the end of the command.
- outputs are expected: the outputs are displayed in sync with the work done on the remote side (for example, ```safescale platform kubectl``` command)

Each command has an exit status which is 0 if it succeeded, and !=0 if failed. If the command displays a result in JSON format, the JSON code contains the same exit code.

The commands are presented in logical order as if the user wanted to create some servers with a shared storage space.
<br>

#### Global options

``safescale`` accepts global_options just before the subcommand, which are :

option | description
----- | -----
`-v` | Increase the verbosity.<br><br>ex: `safescale -v host create ...`
`-d` | Displays debugging information.<br><br>ex: `safescale -d host create ...`

Example:
```bash
$ safescale -v network create mynetwork --cidr 192.168.1.0/24
```
<br>

#### Commands

There are 3 categories of commands:
- the one dealing with tenants (aka cloud providers): [tenant](#tenant)
- the ones dealing with infrastructure resources: [network](#network), [subnet](#subnet), [host](#host), [volume](#volume), [share](#share), [bucket](#bucket), [ssh](#ssh)
- the one dealing with clusters: [cluster](#cluster)

#### tenant

A tenant must be set before using any other command as it indicates to SafeScale which tenant the command must be executed on. _Note that if only one tenant is defined in the `tenants.toml`, it will be automatically selected while invoking any other command.<br>
<!-- A storage tenant represents the credentials needed to connect an object storage they are used to select one or several object storage for [data](#safecale_data) commands<br> -->
The following actions are proposed:

| <div style="width:350px">actions</div> | description |
| --- | --- |
| `safescale tenant list` | List available tenants |
| `safescale tenant get` | Display the current tenant used for action commands. |
| `safescale tenant set <tenant_name>` | Set the tenant to use by the next commands |
<br>

##### safescale tenant list
List available tenants i.e. those found in the `tenants.toml` file.<br><br>example:<br><br>`$ safescale tenant list`<br>`{"result":[{"name":"TestOVH"}],"status":"success"}]`

<br>

##### safescale tenant get
Display the current tenant used for action commands.<br><br>example:<br><br>`$ safescale tenant get`<br>response when tenant set:<br>`{"result":{"name":"TestOVH"},"status":"success"}`<br>reponse when tenant not set:<br>`{"error":{"exitcode":6,"message":"Cannot get tenant: no tenant set"},"result":null,"status":"failure"}`

<br>

##### safescale tenant set <tenant_name>
Set the tenant to use by the next commands. The 'tenant_name' must match one of those present in the `tenants.toml` file (key 'name'). The name is case sensitive.

Example of use:

```bash
$ safescale tenant set TestOvh
```
response on success:
```json
{"result":null,"status":"success"}
```
response on failure:
```json
{"error":{"exitcode":6,"message":"Unable to set tenant 'TestOVH': tenant 'TestOVH' not found in configuration"},"result":null,"status":"failure"}
```

#### network

This command manages Networks on the provider side, in which subnets may be created. In some Cloud Providers terminology, Network can be called VPC (FlexibleEngine, AWS, ...).

Before release v20.09, Cloud Provider networks and subnets were melted into a SafeScale Network. Since release v20.09, Subnets are introduced.
For compatibility reason, default behavior of `safescale network` has been maintain as before, creating by default a Subnet named as the Network with a CIDR derived from the one of the Network.
For example, `safescale network create --cidr 172.16.0.0/16 my-net` will create a Network with a CIDR of 172.16.0.0/16 AND a Subnet inside the Network with a CIDR of 172.16.0.0/17 (this allows to create additional subnets if needed).

Since v20.09, it's now possible to create a Network empty of Subnet, using `--empty` flag, leaving the responsibility of Subnet creation to the user. If `--empty` is used, the flags `--gwname`, `--os`, `--gw-sizing` and `--failover` are meaningless.

#### subnet

This command manages Subnets of Network on the provider side, on which hosts may be attached to (**may** because it's also possible to create a host without attached Subnet but with a public IP address).
In SafeScale, a Host is automatically created to act as the gateway for the Subnet. If not given, default values are used to size this gateway.
The following actions are proposed:

| <div style="width:350px">actions</div> | description |
| ----- | ----- |
| `safescale network create [command_options] <network_name>`|<br>Creates a network with the given name.|

| `safescale network inspect <network_name_or_id>`| Get info of a network|
| `safescale network delete <network_name_or_id>`| Delete the network whose name or id is given|
<br>

##### `safescale network create [command_options] <network_name>`

Creates a network with the given name.

`command_options`:
  - `--cidr <cidr>` cidr of the network (default: "192.168.0.0/24")
  
  - `--empty` do not create a default Subnet in Network (default: creates a Subnet named like the Network with a CIDR included in the one provided for the Network)
      <br><br>The options below are meaningful only without the use of `--empty`:
  - `--gwname <name>` name of the gateway (`gw-<network_name>` by default)
  - `--os "<os name>"` Image name for the gateway (default: "Ubuntu 18.04")
  
  - `-S <sizing>, --sizing <sizing>` describes sizing of gateway in format `"<component><operator><value>[,...]"` where:
    - `<component>` can be `cpu`, `cpufreq` ([scanner](SCANNER.md) needed), `gpu` ([scanner](SCANNER.md) needed), `ram`, `disk`
    - `<operator>` can be `=`,`~`,`<`,`<=`,`>`,`>=` (except for disk where valid operators are only `=` or `>=`):
      - `=` means exactly `<value>`
      - `~` means between `<value>` and 2x`<value>`
      - `<` means strictly lower than `<value>`
      - `<=` means lower or equal to `<value>`
      - `>` means strictly greater than `<value>`
      - `>=` means greater or equal to `<value>`
    - `<value>` can be an integer (for `cpu`, `cpufreq`, `gpu` and `disk`) or a float (for `ram`) or an including interval `[<lower value>-<upper value>]`
      - `<cpu>` is expecting an integer as number of cpu cores, or an interval with minimum and maximum number of cpu cores
      - `<cpufreq>` is expecting an integer as minimum cpu frequency in MHz
      - `<gpu>` is expecting an integer as number of GPU (scanner would have been run first to be able to determine which template proposes GPU)
      - `<ram>` is expecting a float as memory size in GB, or an interval with minimum and maximum memory size
      - `<disk>` is expecting an integer as system disk size in GB
      
    examples:<br>
    
        --sizing "cpu <= 4, ram <= 10, disk >= 100"
        --sizing "cpu ~ 4, ram = [14-32]" (is identical to --sizing "cpu=[4-8], ram=[14-32]")
        --sizing "cpu <= 8, ram ~ 16"
  - `--failover` creates 2 gateways for the network with a VIP used as internal default route

    `$ safescale network delete example_network`
    
response on success:

    `{"result":null,"status":"success"}`
    
response on failure (network does not exist):

    `{"error":{"exitcode":6,"message":"Failed to find 'networks/byName/example_network'"},"result":null,"status":"failure"}`
    
response on failure (subnets still attached to network):

##### `safescale network delete <network_name_or_id>`
Delete the network whose name or id is given. If the Network was created with a default Subnet, this Subnet will be deleted also. Otherwise, if the Network still has Subnets in it, deletion will fail.

example:

    `$ safescale network delete example_network`
    
response on success:

    `{"result":null,"status":"success"}`
    
response on failure (network does not exist):

    `{"error":{"exitcode":6,"message":"Failed to find 'networks/byName/example_network'"},"result":null,"status":"failure"}`
    
response on failure (subnets still attached to network):

    `{"error":{"exitcode":6,"message":"Cannot delete network 'example_network': 1 Subnet is still attached to it"},"result":null,"status":"failure"}`

<!-- #### <a name="safescale_data"></a>data
This command familly aims to push data on object storage on a secured way with data encryption (AES-256/RSA-2048) and & data replication(erasure coding/ several object storage).<br>
As we want to push datas on several object storage we fist have to set [tenantStorage](#safescale_tenant)<br>
All the files are crypted with a key stored on $HOME/.safescale/rsa.key (if the key didn't exists, pushing a file will generate one)<br>

#### env

Some parameters of `safescale`can be set using environment variables:
- SAFESCALED_LISTEN: equivalent to `--server`, allows to tell `safescale` how to reach the daemon `safescaled`.
- SAFESCALE_METADATA_SUFFIX: allows to specify a suffix to add to the name of the Object Storage bucket used to store SafeScale metadata on the tenant.
  This allows to "isolate" metadata between different users of SafeScale (practical in development for example). There is no equivalent command line parameter.
  This environment variable must be on par between `safescale` and `safescaled`, otherwise strange things may happen...
